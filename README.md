# Agentic_Product_Analyst

Agentic_Product_Analyst is an end-to-end AI system that demonstrates how to build an autonomous product and market research agent. Learners following this project will:

- Understand the **basics of the OpenAI Agents SDK** and its core concepts: Agents, Handoffs, Guardrails, and Sessions.
- Connect a **Gemini model** (or other LLMs) to the OpenAI Agents SDK for intelligent reasoning.
- Use **streaming** to visualize the agentâ€™s step-by-step thought process and intermediate outputs.
- Build a **Product Analyst AI Agent** capable of autonomously fetching data, generating insights, and creating interactive visualizations like a professional data analyst.
- Learn **post-processing techniques** to dynamically map agent calls to actual plotting functions, including bar charts, pie charts, word clouds, heatmaps, and more.

This project combines **Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI Agents** to teach practical applications of agentic AI in business intelligence and financial research.
